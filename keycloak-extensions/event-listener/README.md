# Keycloak Event Listener

Some demo event listeners for Keycloak.

## Highlander Session Restrictor

Allowing only the last session to survive, if a user logs in on multiple browsers/devices.

I call it the _Highlander_ mode - _there must only be one!_

## AWS SNS

Simply pushing all events to an AWS SNS topic.

## Last Login Time

Save the last (most recent) login time in an attribute of the user.
